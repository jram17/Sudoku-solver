sudoku solver...using backtracking
The provided Python code implements a Sudoku solver using a backtracking algorithm.
The is_valid function checks whether it's valid to place a number k in a given position (r, c) on the Sudoku grid.
The solve function recursively attempts to fill the Sudoku grid, backtracking when necessary.
Finally, the solver is applied to a sample Sudoku grid, and the solved grid is printed.
